### Risk Analysis Table

| Risk Category | Summary of Risk | Potential Impact | Likelihood (Low/Medium/High) | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Environmental Risks: Greenhouse Gas Emissions | Lack of comprehensive Scope 3 emissions data across the entire supply chain. | Reputational damage, regulatory fines, difficulty meeting emission reduction targets. | Medium | Implementing a system to track Scope 3 emissions across a large panel of suppliers;  supplier engagement and capacity-building programs to encourage responsible business practices. |
| Environmental Risks: Water Usage |  Potential for significant water usage in operations and supply chain (not explicitly stated but implied by focus on water conservation). |  Negative environmental impact, operational disruptions due to water scarcity, reputational damage. | Medium |  Implementing low-water design in buildings and operations;  integrated water management approach to minimize water impacts. |
| Social Risks: Supplier and Vendor Labor Practices | Potential for human rights violations or unethical labor practices within the supply chain. | Reputational damage, legal liabilities, operational disruptions. | Medium |  Third-party managed services provider to assess suppliers and guide their efforts in incorporating responsible business practices;  supplier self-assessments and capacity-building programs;  ESG learning channel for suppliers. |
| Governance Risks: ESG Disclosures and Reporting |  Potential for inaccuracies or incompleteness in ESG reporting, leading to a lack of transparency. |  Investor distrust, regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage. | Medium | Enhanced sustainability reporting with streamlined data and automated emissions reporting;  use of Gen AI ESG analytics solution for accurate GHG emission calculations. |


### Positive Indicators Table
